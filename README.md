# Allen & Heath ACE Protocol implementation

As for now it's only recording audio from broadcasted packets to .wav files splitted by channels. Ultimately it will have integration to WASAPI for multichannel bidirectional audio within iDR-XX Mix Racks.

It's only PoC and will be fully rewritten at version 1.0.0
